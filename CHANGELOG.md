#### Gallery Changelog

#### 2022-07-08

- Added a preference to include (or not) videos in results. Video files (.mp4, .mov, etc) don't display a thumbnail when referenced in a Raycast Grid Item yet, but work as expected when opening the file or using quicklook.
- Updated Grid Item to display file icon for videos instead of a dot icon.
