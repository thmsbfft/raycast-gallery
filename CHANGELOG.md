## [Refined Featureset] - 2022-07-08

- Add a preference to include (or not) videos in results. Video files (.mp4, .mov, etc) don't display a thumbnail when referenced in a Raycast Grid Item yet, but work as expected when opening the file or using quicklook.
- Update Grid Item to display file icon for videos instead of a dot icon.
- Move Grid itemSize into the extension preferences
- Use the Grid Dropdown to swap between "Everything" and each of the input folders. By default, the extension will open to show all folders at once.
